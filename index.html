            <p>
                I'm a passionate and driven information technology student with a strong interest in web development and
                digital solutions. Over time, I have developed a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I
                continuously strive to improve my coding skills and understanding of front-end technologies. I enjoy
                transforming creative ideas into real, functional websites that are not only visually appealing but also
                responsive and user-friendly. My learning journey is powered by curiosity, consistency, and a deep
                desire to solve problems through technology.

                I am currently building my portfolio by working on small projects, learning from open-source
                communities, and staying up to date with the latest trends in web development. In addition to my
                technical abilities, I am a good communicator, a fast learner, and a team player — qualities that I
                believe are essential in any modern tech environment.

                I’m open to opportunities such as internships, collaborations, or freelance work that will allow me to
                grow and gain real-world experience. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to projects while
                continuously learning and becoming a better developer every day.
